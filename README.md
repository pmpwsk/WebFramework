- Automatic SSL certificates using Let's Encrypt
- Pages and elements so you don't have to write any HTML code
- .wfpg files to quickly create static web pages
- Accounts with everything one would expect from an account
- Mail server (incoming and outgoing)
- Object-oriented database
- File server with server cache and browser cache management
- Worker to regularly update files, handle memory integrity, certificates and more
- Plugins (see more below)
- Option for usage as a local web server for local web apps as interfaces for proper apps on a computer
 
...and much more!

Most features have plugins as interfaces.

## Installation
For now, there is no binary you can just install on your server, however, that's in the works.

You can download the source code from <a href="/github">GitHub</a> and add a reference to it from your project.

Soon, there will also be a NuGet package so you can simply install and update that.

This library is based on ASP.NET, so it's best to create an empty ASP.NET project rather than a console app (those will terminate unless paused otherwise).

## Official plugins
- Server (interface for server management by administrator accounts)
- Users (interface for accounts)
- Notes (web app for user's notes)
- Redirects (allows for static redirects)

## Planned plugins
- Mail (mailbox system and interface for the mail server)
- Files (file management for admins and interface for a file server)
- Git (interface for a git server running on the same machine)
- Finances (simple finance manager for users)
